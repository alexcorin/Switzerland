                <h2>The Swiss Food Culture</h2>
                <p class="biggerBreak">If you ever feel like visiting Switzerland you must try some of their national foods which are said to be some of the best and tastiest dishes in the world. The most probable reason for this is the fact that most dishes include different Swiss cheeses and are a mix match of ingredients which offer a wide variety of tastes. One famous Swiss dish is the raclette dish which is eaten by the natives during cold winters as a way to warm their cold stomachs. The dish involves the melting of raclette cheese which is then combined on a plate with meat and vegetables. Other famous foods that come from Switzerland are the Swiss Chocolates which can be found all over the world and perhaps muesli which most European countries eat for breakfast. If you ever want to visit a country that has great food I would definitely recommend visiting Switzerland!</p>

                <h2>A Sportaholic Country</h2>
                <p class="biggerBreak">Like most countries, sports are an important part of the Swiss people's lives and like most European countries the two most popular sports there are football and ice hockey. The Swiss people watch these sports religiously and the country competes regularly in ice hockey world championships and even in the Fifa World Cup seven times!</p>
                <p class="smallBreak">Besides being good at sports that mostly take place in arenas inside, much of the population go skiing in the nearby mountains and have been doing so for generations. Because of the snowy mountains being so easy to access for the Swiss folks they have, much like football and ice hockey, become addicted to winter sports such as skiing. Because of this addiction the country has built many winter sports facilities and tons of ski resorts so that both tourists and Swiss people can enjoy these sports. On top of this the country has also hosted several Winter Olympics showing just how important these sports are to Switzerland and its culture. </p>

                <h2>The Watchmaking Nation</h2>
                <p class="biggerBreak">Besides being masters in foods, Switzerland also has mastered the crafts of watches and could even be called a “watchmaking nation”. The art of watch crafting in Switzerland began way back in the 17th century and continues on today. You have most likely heard or perhaps even own some Swiss made watches for they are exported to all over the world. Some popular Swiss watch brands are Rolex, Omega, Cartier, etc. Although most of these watches are quite expensive they are certainly worth their price for they are carefully crafted. </p>
