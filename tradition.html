            <h2>The Zibelemärit</h2>
            <p>
                On the fourth Monday of November farmers from the surrounding area gather in Bern to sell all kinds of onions.
                At the autumnal market over 50 tons of onions are brought to the onion market with different sizes, colors and forms.
                Some onions are braided into garlands and even wrapped as a sweet for everyone to enjoy.
                There are many legends about the beginning of this tradition.
                One says that during the 15th century the first Zibelmärit was a part of another market called “Martini market”, which did not sell onions and so a separate market was created.
                Another legend says that after Bern's great fire of 1405, people of Freiburg helped the Bernese people after many houses were burnt and people killed.
                As a sign of gratitude the people of Freiburg were allowed to sell onions in Bern every autumn.

            <h2>Cattle descent</h2>
            <p>
                If you enjoy the calmness and the scenery of nature, then cattle descent then this tradition is the right one for you. 
                Between mid-September and mid-October cows with flower crowns, but also sheep and goats descend from the alpine pastures making their way back to the valley. 
                The festivities were originally celebrated as a thanksgiving for summer without accidents. 
                Nowadays the tradition is celebrated with a festival with music, market stalls and dishes as the animals descend.
