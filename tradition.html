            <h2>The Zibelemärit</h2>
            <p>
                On the fourth Monday of November, farmers from the surrounding area gather in Bern to sell all kinds of onions.
                At the Zibelemärit, or the onion market in English, over 50 tons of onions are brought to the market in different sizes, colors, and forms.
                Some onions are braided into garlands and even wrapped as a sweet for everyone to enjoy.
                There are many legends about the beginning of this tradition.
                One says that during the 15th century the first Zibelemärit was part of another market called “Martini market”.
                However it did not sell onions and so a separate market was created.
                Another legend says that after Bern's great fire of 1405, the people of Freiburg helped the Bernese after houses were burnt and many killed.
                As a sign of gratitude, the people of Freiburg were allowed to sell onions in Bern every autumn.

            <p>
                Are you perhaps a night owl or an early bird interested in festivals? Then Basel Fasnacht might be the swiss tradition for you.
                This festival starts at 4 am the first Monday after Ash Wednesday when the sky’s pitch black.
                Follow the masked crowd as they carry hand-painted lanterns that light up the city center.
                Enjoy the sight as they make their way through the streets and appreciate the music of thousands of drummers, flautists, and brass bands.

            <h2>Cattle descent</h2>
            <p>
                If you enjoy the calmness and the scenery oaf nature, then you might fancy cattle descent.
                Between mid-September and mid-October you can experience the decorated animals descend from the alpine pastures to make their way back to the valley.
                These animals are mostly cows with flower crowns, but also sheep and goats. This festivity was originally a way to celebrate summers without problems.
                Nowadays the tradition is celebrated with music, market stalls and dishes as the animals descend.
