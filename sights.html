        <h2 class="titles">The Matterhorn</h2>
        <p class="textColor">The Matterhorn is the absolute spot for the thrillseekers visiting Switzerland! The 4478 meter tall mountain is the fifth highest peak in Switzerland and attracts a lot of tourists every year. It is so well known that it even got the honor of being in the logo for the Toblerone chocolate! 
        </p>
        <p class="textColor">The reason this mountain is one of the more known mountains in Switzerland comes from its iconic pyramid shaped peak, which also makes the mountain harder to climb. But don’t let that stop you from visiting this beauty! The Gotthard Bahn train circles around just below the mountain, making it possible for people to get close without actually climbing the mountain.
        </p>
        <h2 class="titles">Bernina Railway</h2>
        <p class="textColor">An alternative for the perhaps more composed person is the Bernina Railway. This railway line is the perfect travel destination for families in both winter and summertime. The railway line positions itself high up in the Swiss mountains. Some of the highest parts take you as far up as 2250 meters.
        </p>
        <p class="textColor">If you decide to take the Bernina Railway you would begin your journey at the St Moritz station. From there you would travel over several different valleys and bridges during the 60 km long line, ending at the Tirano station in Italy. Now, perhaps that might sound a bit shorter than expected. But don’t get fooled by the rather short distance, this ride will still take over 4 hours to complete!
        </p>
        <h2 class="titles">Rheinfalls</h2>
        <p class="textColor">Are you searching for something more calm? Perhaps a relaxing spot to sit in the evenings to drink your Tea? The Rheinfalls is for you!</p>
        <p class="textColor">The Rhinefalls is situated  just north of Zürich and the most powerful waterfall in Europe. Here you can take in the true power of nature. Hear the water soaring beside you, feel the water dripping on your face or just take in the wonderful architecture of the nearby Laufen castle. If you want to cross, your only choice would be the rhine-bridge located in the upper part of the waterfall. </p>
        <p class="textColor">This is the perfect place for someone who loves what nature can offer and could see themselves spending a part of their day just breathing in the air from this place.</p>
